Your privacy is extremely important to Me. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share Your email address or any other personal information to anyone without Your direct consent.

## 1. Definitions

- **I** and **Me** refers to [Taro TSUKAGOSHI](https://github.com/ttsukagoshi), the sole administrator of this Website.
- **Website** refers to this website at [https://www.scriptable-assets.page/](https://www.scriptable-assets.page/).
- **Services** refers collectively to this Website and the apps, extensions, add-ons, and other types of solutions guided explicitly in this Website, to which I have the right to distribute.
- **You** and **Your** refers to the users or viewers of the Services.

## 2. Data Received and Collected

### 2-1. Log Files

Like many other websites, this Website uses log files to help learn about when, from where, and how often traffic flows to this Website. The information in these log files include:

- Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
- Types of browser
- Internet Service Provider (ISP)
- Date and time stamp
- Referring and exit pages
- Number of clicks

All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### 2-2. Cookies and Web Beacons

If You wish to disable cookies, You may do so through Your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers' websites.

#### 2-2-1. Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this Website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. I also use it in counting the installations of the Services that are hosted in the Chrome Web Store and Google Workspace Marketplace. You can read how Google uses data when You use sites or apps that use Google Analytics at [HOW GOOGLE USES INFORMATION FROM SITES OR APPS THAT USE OUR SERVICES](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### 2-3. Data Collected by Google Workspace Add-ons

All data collected by [Google Workspace Add-ons under this Privacy Policy](/add-ons/) will be used by that Add-on for the sole purpose of executing the respective Add-on's functions at Your explicit request.

The data will only be retained for the length of time it takes for the Add-on to complete the respective execution unless You request them to be saved, using the respective Add-on's "Save settings" or equivalent functions. To protect your data in such cases, the data will be saved as User Properties of the Add-on, which are only accessible by the same Add-on and same user. The data will not be shared with Me, anyone else, or any other Add-ons. The respective Add-ons will be equipped with an user-accessible function which You can invoke to delete the saved data at any time. For more information on User Properties, see [Properties Service - Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties#comparison_of_property_stores)

The following items are the types of data that the respective Add-ons may temporarily collect:

#### 2-3-1. Group Merge

- **User's Gmail address and primary locale (language setting)**: The user's locale will be used to display the Add-on's user interface in the user's preferred language whenever possible. If the language of the user's choice is not available, the Add-on will default to English. The user's Gmail address will be used to notify the user of the Add-on's progress and results of the mail merge.
- **Contents of the Google Sheets file that the user designates as the list of recipients of the merged emails**: This data will be used to execute mail merge and will not be saved in the add-on after the emails are sent or created as drafts in the user's Gmail account.
- **Contents of the Gmail draft that You designate as the template of the merged emails**: This data will be used to execute mail merge and will not be saved in the add-on after the emails are sent or created as drafts in the user's Gmail account.
- **User settings that the user specifies in the Add-on's sidebar**: The settings will be used to execute mail merge or send the draft emails that the Add-on created on behalf of the user. The settings can be saved as User Properties of the Add-on, which the user can delete at any time using the Add-on's "Restore default settings" button.

#### 2-3-2. Unshare

- **User's Gmail address and primary locale (language setting)**: The user's locale will be used to display the Add-on's user interface in the user's preferred language whenever possible. If the language of the user's choice is not available, the Add-on will default to English. The user's Gmail address will be used to determine whether they own the file/folder that they selected when using the Add-on.

- **Permissions of file/folder(s)**: The Add-on will access the permissions of file/folder(s) that the user selected on the Google Drive UI. If the user has activated the Add-on via Google Sheets, Slides, or Docs UI, the scope of access will be limited to the particular file on which this Add-on was activated. Permissions in this context includes the account addresses of the owner, editors, and viewers of the file/folder, and the access status of the file/folder, i.e. the general scope of who can access the file/folder (e.g., _Anyone with link_, _Restricted_, _Domain_). The permission is used to show the user a confirmation message of whether they really want to remove the editors' and viewers' access from the selected file/folder(s). After the confirmation, the add-on will remove the editors' and viewers' access from the selected file/folder(s) and change the access status to _Restricted_, i.e., no one except the owner of the file/folder will be able to access the file unless explicitly granted so.

### 2-4. Contact Information

In any case that You [contact Me](#contact), I will use Your name and email address that You provide me for the sole purpose of replying to You on the subject of the contact, and nothing else. I will not share Your information with anyone else.  
All contents of the correspondence, including email contents from You and My replies to them, will be archived for an indefinite time by default. If You wish them to be deleted, You can [contact Me](#contact) stating which correspondence you want deleted.
